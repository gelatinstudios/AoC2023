## AOC 2023

Doing them in whatever language I feel like this year, rather than just C.

| Day    | Language                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------  |
| 1      | x64 fasm (linux only), also python just cuz       |
| 2      | Haskell (depends on package `split`)              |
