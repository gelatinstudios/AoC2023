## AOC 2023

Doing them in whatever language I feel like this year, rather than just C.

My goal with these is not to make the fastest or most elegant solutions.
These are just what I used to solve each problem.
Once I get the program to spit out the answer to both parts, I don't really go back and edit my code.
I do give myself arbitrary goals that I stick to each year as a bit of a tradition I guess:
  - Each solution should only read from stdin, no file IO
  - Each day should be one program that prints the solution to part 1, then the solution to part 2
  - Try not to simply copy-and-paste for part 2, but instead edit and re-use the code for part 1 as much as possible

That last point has the caveat of people not ever seeing the actual code I used for part 1,
and only seeing the code that's been factored to solve both parts.
To solve this, maybe next year I'll make a habit of saving my part 1 code separately.
I'll still stick to the arbitrary goal of making sure my part 2 version still prints out part 1's solution.

| Day    | Language                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------  |
| 1      | x64 fasm (linux only), also python just cuz       |
| 2      | Haskell (depends on package `split`)              |
| 3      | C99                                               |
| 4      | Haskell (depends on package `split`)              |
| 5      | Python                                            |
| 6      | Python                                            |
| 7      | Haskell                                           |
